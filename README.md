# Contingency-Planning
ðŸš¨ Disaster Recovery & Business Continuity Plan â€“ SavorySauce Restaurant (Cybersecurity Simulation)
 
This project outlines a comprehensive Disaster Recovery (DR) and Business Continuity Plan (BCP) designed to mitigate the impact of cyberattacks targeting SavorySauce Restaurant, a simulated restaurant business environment. It was created as part of a cybersecurity academic/practical exercise to demonstrate strategic planning, risk management, and incident response.

### Skills Learned

Cybersecurity Risk Assessment
- Identifying, categorizing, and prioritizing cyber threats (e.g., ransomware, DDoS, phishing, insider threats).

Business Impact Analysis (BIA)
- Evaluating critical business functions and the consequences of disruption.

Disaster Recovery & Continuity Planning
- Designing detailed recovery strategies for data, applications, and infrastructure.

Incident Response Coordination
- Structuring a communication and escalation path for crisis situations.

Compliance Awareness
- Understanding of NIST CSF and ISO 22301 standards.

Plan Testing and Maintenance
- Creating an iterative testing approach and versioning system for updates.

### Tools Used

- NIST Cybersecurity Framework â€“ For structuring risk response strategy.
- ISO 22301 â€“ As a baseline for BCP standards.
